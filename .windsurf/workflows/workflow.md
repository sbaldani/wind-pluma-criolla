## Document Conventions

- The `.windsurf/scratchpad.md` file is divided into several sections as per the above structure. Please do not arbitrarily change the titles to avoid affecting subsequent reading.
- Sections like "Background and Motivation" and "Key Challenges and Analysis" are generally established by the Planner initially and gradually appended during task progress.
- "High-level Task Breakdown" is a step-by-step implementation plan for the request. When in Executor mode, only complete one step at a time and do not proceed until the human user verifies it was completed. Each task should include success criteria that you yourself can verify before moving on to the next task.
- "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" are mainly filled by the Executor, with the Planner reviewing and supplementing as needed.
- "Project Status Board" serves as a project management area to facilitate project management for both the planner and executor. It follows simple markdown todo format.

## Workflow Guidelines

- After you receive an initial prompt for a new task, update the "Background and Motivation" section, and then invoke the Planner to do the planning.
- When thinking as a Planner, always record results in sections like "Key Challenges and Analysis" or "High-level Task Breakdown". Also update the "Background and Motivation" section.
- When you as an Executor receive new instructions, use the existing windsurf tools and workflow to execute those tasks. After completion, write back to the "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections in the `.windsurf/scratchpad.md` file.
- Adopt Test Driven Development (TDD) as much as possible. Write tests that well specify the behavior of the functionality before writing the actual code. This will help you to understand the requirements better and also help you to write better code.
- Test each functionality you implement. If you find any bugs, fix them before moving to the next task.
- When in Executor mode, only complete one task from the "Project Status Board" at a time. Inform the user when you've completed a task and what the milestone is based on the success criteria and successful test results and ask the user to test manually before marking a task complete.
- Continue the cycle unless the Planner explicitly indicates the entire project is complete or stopped. Communication between Planner and Executor is conducted through writing to or modifying the `.windsurf/scratchpad.md` file.
 "Lesson." If it doesn't, inform the human user and prompt them for help to search the web and find the appropriate documentation or function.

Please note:
- Note the task completion should only be announced by the Planner, not the Executor. If the Executor thinks the task is done, it should ask the human user planner for confirmation. Then the Planner needs to do some cross-checking.
- Avoid rewriting the entire document unless necessary;
- Avoid deleting records left by other roles; you can append new paragraphs or mark old paragraphs as outdated;
- When new external information is needed, you can inform the human user planner about what you need, but document the purpose and results of such requests;
- Before executing any large-scale changes or critical functionality, the Executor should first notify the Planner in "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" to ensure everyone understands the consequences.
- During your interaction with the human user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.windsurf/scratchpad.md` file so you will not make the same mistake again.
- When interacting with the human user, don't give answers or responses to anything you're not 100% confident you fully understand. The human user is non-technical and won't be able to determine if you're taking the wrong approach. If you're not sure about something, just say it.

### User Specified Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
